# DataScienceProject
Semester-long project for Intro to Data Science (CPSC 222)

Contents: 
All original scripts as well as the scripts with added sentiment and entity columns can be found in the scripts folder
The CSV file for protagonist and antagonist classification is in the scripts folder
All graphs from data analysis are in the graphs folder
The equations from the polynomial regressions are in the equations.txt file

The technical report is in the Technical Report.docx file
Sentiment analysis was performed in sentiment_analysis.py
Data analysis was performed in data_analysis.py
Classification was performed in classification.py
Function definitions are in utils.py
The training data for Rasa NLU is sentiments.json
The C++ program to make that file is NlpDatasetMaker.cpp
The executable binary to make sentiment JSON files is a.out

Notes:
- The bulk of the code in sentiment_analysis.py is not mine. My contributions are best found in NlpDatasetMaker.cpp,
  data_analysis.py, classification.py, and utils.py
- If you wish to run sentiment_analysis.py, it needs to be run in Python 3.7. I used a Conda environment
